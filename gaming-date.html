        <br> SHALL THE JOYS OF TODAY THRIVES FOR TOMORROW</h1>
        
        <p class="text1"> Gaming dates </p>
        <p class="text2">These are my favorite kind of dates because I get to play the games that I love with you. I also get to enjoy 
            the fact that you are havin fun along with me, even though sometimes saputon ka sa atong gi duwaan but regardless, 
            these are the best dates that we do. </p>
        <p class="text3">As I am writing this, we have not really played that much anymore, likely due to the fact that we both got our own 
            things and difficulties in our lives, but I really can not deny the fact that I really do miss playing random horror 
            games sa roblox, 1v1s sa VALORANT, trashtalk teammates because they're bad even though bottom frag sad ta.</p>
        <p class="text4">In all honesty, I thought we get to share the same moments quite more ofted because wala nay class and it is going to be less
            restrictive for the both of us. But I am fine as things are as long as I know that you are making the most of your day.
            To see you have fun is also fun for me.</p>
